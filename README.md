A powerful, feature-rich scientific calculator application built with modern vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, and CSS3. This project demonstrates a strong understanding of core web development concepts, including DOM manipulation, state management, event handling, and the integration of third-party libraries.

## Features

This calculator goes beyond basic arithmetic and includes a full suite of features required for scientific and algebraic calculations.

#### Core Calculation Engine:
- **Full Mathematical Parsing:** Powered by the robust `math.js` library for safe and accurate evaluation of complex expressions.
- **Standard Operations:** Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), Division (`/`).
- **Advanced Operations:** Exponentiation (`^`) and Square Root (`sqrt(number)` syntax).
- **Trigonometric Functions:** `sin()`, `cos()`, and `tan()`.
- **Mathematical Constants:** `pi` (or `Ï€`) and `e` are fully supported.
- **Order of Operations:** Correctly handles operator precedence and nested parentheses `( )` automatically.

#### User Interface & Experience:
- **Editable Display:** A fully editable input field allows users to type expressions directly with their keyboard or use the on-screen buttons.
- **Responsive Layout:** The interface is designed with Flexbox and Grid for usability across different screen sizes.
- **Real-time Feedback:** The result is shown in a separate, clear display area without overwriting the user's input.
- **Intuitive Error Handling:** Displays a clear "Error" message for invalid expressions (e.g., division by zero, syntax errors) without crashing the application.

#### State Management & Persistence:
- **User-Defined Variables:** Users can create and store their own variables (e.g., `x = 10`) and use them in subsequent calculations (`x * 5`). Includes validation to prevent using reserved names.
- **Persistent History Panel:** A dedicated, scrollable panel displays a complete history of all calculations.
- **Local Storage:** The calculation history is saved to the browser's `localStorage`, ensuring it persists even after the page is refreshed.
- **Interactive History:** Users can click on any history item to load it back into the input for re-use or modification.
- **History Management:** Individual history items can be deleted with a single click.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For the core structure and semantics of the application.
- **CSS3:** For all styling, layout (Flexbox & Grid), and responsiveness.
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** For all application logic, DOM manipulation, and event handling.
- **Math.js:** An external library for safely parsing and evaluating complex mathematical expressions.
